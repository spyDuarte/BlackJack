# Future Improvements

- **Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive E2E tests covering edge cases (e.g. splitting multiple times).
- **Game History**: Implement a feature to show past hands and results.
- **UI Architecture**: Consider refactoring UI updates to use a lightweight reactive approach if complexity grows.
- **Localization**: Support multiple languages (currently hardcoded to Portuguese).
